# Lab 2 - Automating Debt Collection 🤖

## Lab Purpose

In **Lab 1**, you successfully configured the **Webex Contact Center (WxCC) Campaign Manager** to initiate proactive outbound calls to customers with an upcoming debt. While Lab 1 focused on the "how" to reach the customer, **Lab 2** focuses on the "what"—the intelligent conversation that follows.

In this lab, you will connect those outbound calls to **Alex**, an autonomous AI Agent for **Webex Financial Group**. Alex is not just a chatbot; it is a specialized financial assistant designed to handle the sensitive process of debt recovery, account inquiries, and fraud detection. This lab will guide you through configuring the AI's persona, its strict security protocols, and its ability to execute real-time financial actions.


???+ purpose "Lab Objectives"
    The purpose of this lab is to transform a standard outbound call into a secure, automated financial transaction. You will configure the AI Agent to automate the debt collection process. 

    Key objectives include:

    *   **Persona Implementation:** Configuring the AI Agent persona to be professional, firm, and helpful.
    *   **Automated Debt Payment:** Use the **NovaPay service** to Create a payment session for the customer to realize the payment. 
    *   **Customer Enquiry:** Incorporate Knowledge for Alex to properly respond to customer enquiries. We will use the new **URL injection** for this.
    *   **Risk Management:** Implementing escalation logic that identifies fraudulent or suspicious transactions and triggers a hand-off to a human specialist with all relevant transaction context.

???+ Challenge "Lab Outcome"
    By the end of Lab 2, you will have a fully operational AI Agent integrated into your outbound campaign. The agent will be capable of:

    1.  **Secure Verification:** Confirming the identity of the recipient and obtaining consent for an authentication check.
    2.  **Debt Resolution:** Informing customers of their balance and maturity dates, then negotiating total or partial payments.
    3.  **Financial Execution:** Creating real-time payment sessions via **NovaPay** and confirming completion to update the Debt Database.
    4.  **Account Support:** Providing 7-day transaction histories and general account details (Balance, Rewards, etc.) upon request.
    5.  **Fraud Safeguarding:** Automatically detecting disputes or suspicious activity and escalating the call to a Human Specialist while recording critical data points (Transaction ID, Vendor, Amount).


???+ Tool "The NovaPay payment service"
    In this lab, you will use a NovaPay mock-payment service built for the purpose of this Bootcamp. The NovaPay service provides:

    1. A mockpayment frontend web site that mimics a typical payment user interface. The frontend offers a user interface to enter the payment data: amount, card option (visa, mastercard...) and  card details (name, number, expiration date and cvv). It allows a user to enter the data and click on a pay button to confirm the payment. The web site responds with a confirmation message that the payment has been completed. The user will see the amount payed, the last 4 digits of its credit card and a mock confirmation number.

        ???+ warning  
            This is a UI simulation only. It does not process real payments, store data, or connect to any backend.

            Note: The application does not run any format validation on the input data

    2. A web service that exposes an API to allow a third party to open a payment session for the customer to pay and complete the payment. It also provides the session status to check whether the payment has been completed. You will use this API to implement the payment automation in your AI Agent. 

???+ Curious "Want to have your own **NovaPay** service for your Demos?"
    The [Extra Lab](lab_novapay.md) in this Bootcamp provides you a **step-by-step guide** to replicate and deploy your own version of the **NovaPay Payment Service**, using the existing implementation done for this Bootcamp

    ???+ tip "Writing Goals for Autonomous AI Agents"
        - Keep goals short, concise, and focused on the overall purpose.
        - Avoid specific details, technical jargon, or multiple unrelated goals in one prompt.
        - Use clear language aligned with the agent’s capabilities.

???+ webex "Giving Alex a brain"

    Once your agent is created, you need to give him the instructions on what to do. In Webex Contact Center, the *System Prompt* is the operational "brain" of your AI Agent. Following [Webex Best Practices](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/nelkmxk/Guidelines-and-best-practices-for-automating-with-AI-agent#concept-template_cce8a04c-a0d8-4c35-b20b-e5846eaf5293), a well-structured prompt ensures the LLM manages intent, handles security, and orchestrates tools correctly.

        ???+ Challenge "Build your own prompt!"
            We encourage you to use this proposed structure as a foundation, but don't hesitate to leverage advanced AI tools like *ChatGPT* or *Gemini* to refine the language. By providing these tools with a detailed description of the agent's purpose—debt recovery, secure authentication, and fraud escalation—you can generate a highly sophisticated prompt that handles natural conversation fluently. Experiment with different tones and instructions to see how they impact the agent's decision-making during the call!

    You have now created your AI Agent with its own profile, but note that the Agent has not yet been published. 

    ???+ tip "Managing Alex's Conversational capabilities"

        From the **Conversation** tab of your AI Agent configuration you can manage the Conversational settings of the Agent.

        To transform a technical interaction into a natural dialogue, you must fine-tune how Alex speaks and listens. Under the **Conversation** tab, you have four primary levers to control the "human" feel of your debt collection agent:

        1. Persona and Presence (Voice & Style)
        The *Response Style* dictates the agent's "thinking" behavior. Choosing Active ensures the agent provides immediate verbal cues like "I understand" or "Got it," which is essential in debt collection to reassure the customer they are being heard. Pairing this with *Disfluencies* (fillers like "um") and a calibrated Speaking Rate (0.7 to 1.2) creates a relatable, less robotic persona.

        2. Recognition Precision (Custom *Vocabulary*)
        Technical jargon or specific brand names like "NovaPay" or "QDF" can sometimes trip up standard AI. Use the Custom *Vocabulary* field to program up to 100 industry-specific terms, ensuring the agent correctly identifies intent even when customers use niche terminology.

        3. Fluidity and Patience (*Delays & Interruptions*)
        Managing the "silence" is critical. The *End of Speech Sensitivity* slider determines how quickly Alex responds once a customer stops talking. For high-stress calls, a Relaxed setting (closer to 2000 ms) prevents the agent from cutting the customer off. The *Caller turn timeout* defines the specific time the system waits before checking if the customer has finished speaking. This setting helps to prevent the agent from "clipping" the caller. In a debt collection scenario, customers often pause to look up credit card details or account numbers; a slightly higher timeout (closer to 3000 ms) ensures Alex doesn't interrupt them while they are searching for information. Additionally, enabling *Allow customer to interrupt* is vital for empathy, allowing Alex to stop speaking the moment the customer voice-activates.

        4. Technical Guardrails (Timeouts & *DTMF*)
        Finally, use Timeouts to manage the "dead air." The *No-input timeout* ensures the agent re-engages if a customer goes silent, while *DTMF* settings provide a fallback for secure data entry, allowing customers to use their keypad to signal the end of a digit string (e.g., using #) during the authentication phase. 

        In this lab we are not prescripting the conversational parameters to use. We leave you to play with them and evaluate the conversational effect they produce.

## Lab 2.2 - Feed Alex with a Knowledge Base

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) ingestion is the process of collecting, structuring, and indexing enterprise data—such as documents, FAQs, or knowledge articles—into a searchable format (typically embeddings in a vector database). This enables AI agents to dynamically retrieve the most relevant information at runtime, grounding their responses in trusted sources and forming the foundation of accurate, up-to-date Knowledge Bases.

To ensure Alex can handle more than just transactional data, you will now provide the agent with a Knowledge Base. This section involves linking documentation regarding Webex Financial Group’s policies, general banking FAQs, and service descriptions. This allows the agent to answer "General Enquiries" accurately without needing a human specialist for basic informational questions. 

Webex AI Agent supports three types of sources for the Knowledge Base: 

- *Files*: upload PDF, .docx, .doc, .txt, .xlsx, .xls, and .CSV files.
- *Articles*: editalbe documents in the AI Agent Studio
- *Websites*: website content using web URLs

We will use the new **Web URL ingestion** mechanism. Website extraction uses automated crawling techniques to browse the internet to find and download the relevant content from web pages and transform it into knowledge that your AI agents can access. Crawling begins with the starting URL that you provide. Based on the depth and the page limits 
that you specify, the crawler application navigates from the home page, visits the websites, and 
fetches the required content based on the URL patterns and sub-domain definitions.

???+ webex "Web ingestion for the Knowledge-Base Configuration"

    For the sake of the Bootcamp, we have created a simple content and pushed it to a website that you can access through the   Bootcamp Web Lab documentation at [Webex Bank Knowledge Base](https://cx-partner.github.io/bootcamp2026/bcamp_files/Webex_Financial_Group_KB/) tab.

???+ webex "OPTIONAL!! -- File ingestion for the Knowledge-Base Configuration"

    While web ingestion is ideal for dynamic content, state-of-the-art AI agents often require access to specific, structured data housed in internal documents. In this section, you will explore the file ingestion capability, which allows you to upload PDFs, DocX, or text files directly into the AI Agent’s Knowledge Base. This can be a critical functionality in certain scenarios, as it enables the agent to reference specific policy manuals, updated credit terms, or internal FAQs that are not publicly available on the web. By using this ingestion method, you ensure your agent has a robust, multi-source intelligence layer to handle complex customer inquiries.

    The content uploaded in this section is exactly the same as with the Web Ingestion method, so you can actually skip this step. We keep it here to show how file ingestion is configured in the AI Agent Studio.

## Lab 2.3 - Build the fulfillment Actions

This is where you give Alex the power to interact with your backend systems. You will configure the specific functional "tools" or actions that the agent can execute during a call. You will define and map the following critical actions:

- [fetch_balance]: To retrieve real-time customer data.
- [authenticate_user]: To verify customer identity.
- [payment_session]: To trigger a NovaPay session and email a URL.
- [payment_confirm]: To validate and update the database after a payment.
- [fetch_transactions]: To pull the last transactions of account activity.

???+ info "AI Agent handover to Human Agents"
     Note the **Agent handover** action is enabled by default allowing the AI agent to escalate the conversation to a human agent. It is always displayed in the Actions page of the AI agent configuration, where it can be enabled or disabled using the toggle option.

### **[fetch_balance]** Action

The *fetch_balance* action will provide the AI Agent with all the necessary customer data to handle debt collection and to resolve customer queries. It will basically use the Airtable API to fetch the required information from your Customer table. 

These are the required steps: 

* [x] Create the fulfillment flow that will implement the action in Webex Connect
* [x] Create the action in the AI Agent

???+ webex "Action fulfillment flow in Webex Connect"

    You will first build the WxConnect flow that implements the action. 

    1. Go to **Control Hub** ->  **Contact Center** ->  **Overview** and under Digital Channels launch **[Webex Connect]**
    2. If you have not done it yet, create a new Service for your Bootcamp. 

        - Click on **[Create New Service]**
        - Give it a name <copy>`Webex Finance Bootcamp`</copy> and click on **[Create]**

        ???+ info "Create Service in WxConnect"
            <figure markdown>
            ![Create Service](./assets/Create%20Service.png)
            </figure>

    3. Go to your Service and click on **[Flows]** to create your fulfillment flow
        - Click on **[Create Flow]**
        - Give your flow a name <copy>`fetch_balance`</copy>
        - Select **New Flow** under **Method**
        - Select **Start from Scratch**
        - Click on **[Create]**
    4. Configure the Start Node to trigger the flow from AI Agent
        
        - Select the **AI Agent Event**
        - Set the **SAMPLE JSON** to the below one 
            ```json
            {
                "PhoneNumber": "23434523489"
            }
            ```
        ???+ info 
            The variable name in the Json sample must match the corresponding entity in the AI Agent action.

        - Click on **[Parse]**
        - Click on **[Save]**
        
         ???+ info 
            Flows do not autosave, so make sure you save your flow whenever you make edits.

        ???+ gif "Create the fulfillment flow"
            <figure markdown>
            ![Create the Flow](./assets/fetch_balance%20flow%201.gif)
            </figure>

    5. We will first normalize the phone number using a **Evaluate** node to prepare it for the database query in our Airtable base. 
        - Drag and drop an **Evaluate** node to the canvas besides the **Start Node**
        - Connect the green outlet of the **Start Node** to the new **Evaluate** node.
        - Double click on the **Evaluate** node
        - Rename the node to <copy>`Normalize Phone Number`</code>
        - Copy the below javascript code in the code editor of the node
            ```javascript
            var phone_Number = "$(n2.aiAgent.PhoneNumber)".replace(/\+/g, "")
            .replace(/ /g, "")
            .replace(/\(/g, "")
            .replace(/\)/g, "")
            .replace(/\-/g, "");

            var formula = "";

            formula = '{PhoneNumber}="' + phone_Number + '"';
            1;
            ```
            
            ???+ warning
                Make sure the $(n2.aiAgent.PhoneNumber) variable corresponds to your PhoneNumber variable in the Start Node. You can pick it up by selecting it from the **Input Variables** right panel, under the **Start** section. 
            
            
            ???+ info 
                This code is a string cleaning and formatting script designed to prepare a phone number for the database query. The first part uses Regex to strip away non-numeric characters, converting the number from `+1 (555) 123-4567` -> `15551234567`. 
                
                The second block builds a specific string that Airtable use to find a record in the `filterByFormula` API query parameter. This code can be easily generated with `Generate Code using AI` option in the  Evaluate node or any other LLM (Geminy, Claude...)

        - Set the **Script Output** value to `1`
        - Set the **Branch Name** value to `Success`
        - Click on **[Save]**
        - Save the flow

        ???+ gif "Set the Evaluate Node"

            ![Set the Evaluate node](./assets/fetch_balance%20flow%202.gif)
            </figure>

    6. In the last step you will fetch the customer data from your Airtable Customers repository. 

        ???+ Important
            This part of the flow will leverage the Airtable API generated from your *Customer* table. So you must have:

            - your Airtable base created, with the Customer Table populated
            - your [Airtable API](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) handy for your base (from the API Reference site, click on the base you created for the Bootcamp. To see personalized documentation generated for your bases, log in to Airtable.). Your Airtable Base API is available at `https://airtable.com/<yourBaseID>/api/docs`
            - Your [Personal Access token](https://airtable.com/create/tokens) created.  

            The API we will use in this flow will be as follows: 

            ``` text
            GET     https://api.airtable.com/v0/<yourBaseID>/Customers
            ```

            To fetch the correct entry, we will use the `filterByFormula` query parameter set to the string value returned by the **Evaluate** node which corresponds to customer's normalized phone number. 

        - Drag and drop an **HTTP Request** node to the canvas besides the **Evaluate** node
        - Connect the green outlet of the **Evaluate** node to the new **HTTP Request** node.
        - Double click on the **HTTP Request** node
        - Rename the node to <copy>`Fetch Customer Info`</code>
        - Fill in the parameters as follows: 

            | Parameter | Value | Notes |
            | :--- | :--- | :--- |
            | **Method** | `GET` | |
            | **Endpoint URL** | <copy>`https://api.airtable.com/v0/<yourBaseID>/Customers?filterByFormula=$(formula)` </copy>| Replace `yourBaseID` with the value of your Airtable Base|
            | **Header** | <copy>`Authorization`</copy>  |  |
            | **Value** | `Bearer <yourPersonalToken>` |  Enter `yourPersonalToken`from [Airtable](https://airtable.com/create/tokens)|
            | **Header** | <copy>`Content-Type`</copy> | click **+ Add Another Header** |
            | **Value** | <copy>`application/json`</copy> |  |

            | **Request Timeout** | <copy>`10000`</copy> |  |

        - Let's now fill in the Output Variables. For this we will use a json sample of the API output to select those values that we need for our flow. 

            - Make sure the **JSON** radio button is enabled in the **Output Variables** section.
            - Click on **Import From Sample**

    7. To finish your fulfillment flow, we need to pass on the output variables back to your AI Agent. The way to do it is through the **Flow Outcomes**

        ???+ info
            The AI Agent is notified of flow completion. By default, the notification for AI Agent is enabled under the flow setting with the default payload. On flow completion, you can update the payload shared with the AI Agent using the **Flow Outcomes**


        - Click on the :fontawesome-solid-gear: button at the top right of the flow editor. 
        - Click on the **Flow Outcomes** tab
        - Open the ‘Last Execution Status’ Outcome. The ‘Notify AI Agent’ radio button is enabled by default for the start node with 'AI Agent’ as the trigger.
        - To return all the values fetched from the Airtable Customers repository, we need to add the Key and Value of every Output Variable we stored in the HTTP Request node. Click on **+ Add New** for every parameter in the list below. Fetch the **Value** variables from the **Input Variables** right panel, under the **HTTP Request** section.

            |		Key		|	Value	|

            - Rewards tier
            - Credit card
            - Email
        ```
    4. ~~**Action scope**: select *Slot filling and fulfillment*~~ This option has been removed
    5. Under **Slot filling** click on **[New input entity]**
    6. In the **Add a new input entity** dialogue window, populate: 

        | Entity Name | Type | Description | Example | Required |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | <copy>`PhoneNumber`</copy> | `String` | <copy>`Customer's phone number`</copy> | <copy>`13458752396`</copy> |`Required` |

        ???+ info 
            The entity name must match the parameter name defined in the Agent start node JSON input within the fulfillment flow.

    7. The last step to complete the action is to associate the fulfillment flow in Webex Connect with the action. This is done in the **Webex Connect Flow Builder Fulfillment** section
        - Select the Webex Connect Service `Webex Finance Bootcamp`
        - Select the flow `fetch_balance``
    8. Click on **[-> Add]**

### [Authenticate_user] Action

The *authenticate_user* action facilitates secure customer verification. It generates two random indices between 1 and 4, extracts the digits at those positions from the stored 4-digit PIN, and provides them to the AI Agent. The Agent uses this data to conduct a challenge-response validation with the customer.

We will proceed as in the previous action: 

* [x] Create the fulfillment flow that will implement the action in Webex Connect
* [x] Create the action in the AI Agent

???+ webex "Action fulfillment flow in Webex Connect"

    1. Go to your *Webex Finance Bootcamp* Service in Webex Connect
    2. Click on **[Flows]** to create your new flow
        - Click on **[Create Flow]**
        - Give your flow a name <copy>`authenticate_user`</copy>
        - Select **New Flow** under **Method**
        - Select **Start from Scratch**
        - Click on **[Create]**

            ```json
            {
            "PIN": "1234"
            }
            ```

            </figure>

    4. The next step in our flow will be to generate two random positions between 1 and 4 and extract the digits at those positions from the PIN. We will use an **Evaluate** node

        - Drag and drop an **Evaluate** node to the canvas besides the **Start Node**
        - Connect the green outlet of the **Start Node** to the new **Evaluate** node.
        - Double click on the **Evaluate** node
        - Rename the node to <copy>`Extract PIN positions`</code>
        - Copy the below javascript code in the code editor of the node
            ```javascript
            var position1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) + 1;
            var position2;

            // Keep generating position2 until it is different from position1
            do {
            position2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) + 1;
            } while (position1 === position2);

            if (position1 > position2) {
            var temp = position1;
            position1 = position2;
            position2 = temp;
            }

            // Convert to string just in case it's a number
            var pinStr = "$(n2.PIN)".toString();

            // Extract digits (Position 1 is Index 0, Position 2 is Index 1, etc.)
            var digit1 = pinStr.charAt(position1 - 1);
            var digit2 = pinStr.charAt(position2 - 1);

            1;
            ```

            ???+ warning
                Make sure the $(n2.PIN) variable corresponds to your PIN variable in the Start Node. You can pick it up by selecting it from the **Input Variables** right panel, under the **Start** section. 
            
            
            ???+ info 
                This code implements a partial PIN challenge by selecting two unique, random positions between 1 and 4. It uses a do...while loop to ensure the second position never matches the first, then sorts them numerically so the AI Agent always prompts for digits in sequential order (e.g., "the 1st and 3rd digits"). Finally, it casts the stored PIN to a string and uses charAt() to extract the specific digits, adjusting for zero-based indexing to ensure the correct values are retrieved for verification. It ultimately returns these two extracted digits as the result of the authentication action.

        - Set the **Script Output** value to `1`
        - Set the **Branch Name** value to `Success`
        - Click on **[Save]**
        - To complete the node, click on the green outlet at the right and drag it to the canvas. Release it to open the **End** dialogue

            - Set the **Node Event** value to `1 (Success)`
            - Set the **Flow Result** value to `101 - Successfully completed flow [Success]`

        - Account Management: Does it provide an accurate account balance and present options for both total and partial payments.
        - Knowledge & Context: Does it accurately resolve queries using the integrated Knowledge Base or specific customer data points? 

    
### **[payment_session]** Action

In this lab, you will configure the [payment_session] action to enable your AI Agent to process financial transactions through NovaPay. Before beginning, ensure that a functional email channel is available as a prerequisite in your tenant, as this is required to deliver the transaction URL to the customer. You will build the logic to trigger the payment gateway, create a payment session and automate the delivery of the unique session link to the email address stored in your database.

As in the previous actions, we will: 

* [x] Create the fulfillment flow that will implement the action in Webex Connect

### [confirm_payment] Action

With the NovaPay session initiated and the payment URL sent, the final step in the debt resolution flow is verification. The *payment_confirm* action acts as the AI Agent’s 'closing clerk.' In this section, you will configure the logic that allows Alex to move beyond simply providing a link to actually validating the transaction's success. This action queries the NovaPay API to check the real-time status of the payment session. Once a 'Success' state is detected, the agent will trigger a synchronized update to the Debt Database, ensuring the customer's balance is reconciled immediately. Mastering this action is key to building an autonomous agent that doesn't just talk about debt, but actively resolves it.

As before, we will follow our typical approach: 

* [x] Create the fulfillment flow that will implement the action in Webex Connect
* [x] Create the action in the AI Agent

        - Select the flow `confirm_payment`
    8. Click on **[-> Add]**

    You can see now your new action in the **Actions** panel of your AI Agent.


### [fetch_transactions] Action

The *fetch_transaction* action provides the AI Agent with "financial memory," transforming a generic debt collection call into a personalized account review. In this section, you will configure the agent to bridge the gap between two critical data points: using the {{CustomerID}} retrieved during the initial balance check to unlock the Airtable Transactions table. By mapping this function, you enable Alex to retrieve a snapshot of the **five most recent** account activities—including dates, vendors, and amounts. This transparency is vital for resolving disputes and providing the customer with a clear history, ensuring that the conversation is rooted in real-time data rather than general estimates.

To retrieve a record in Airtable, we will use a GET request to the record enpoint, using the [Airtable API](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction). 

We will follow the well known steps: 

* [x] Create the fulfillment flow that will implement the action in Webex Connect
* [x] Create the action in the AI Agent

???+ webex "Action fulfillment flow in Webex Connect"

    Let´s build the WxConnect flow that implements the action. 

    
    3. In Webex Connect, go to your Service and click on **[Flows]** to create your fulfillment flow
        - Click on **[Create Flow]**
        - Give your flow a name <copy>`fetch_transactions`</copy>
        - Select **New Flow** under **Method**
        - Select **Start from Scratch**
        - Click on **[Create]**
    4. Configure the Start Node to trigger the flow from AI Agent
        
        ???+ inline end "Screenshot - AI Agent Start node"
            <figure markdown>
            ![Start node](./assets/fetch_transactions%20flow%201.png)
            </figure>

        - Select the **AI Agent Event**
        - Set the **SAMPLE JSON** to the below one 
            ```json
            {
                "CustomerID": "recZkHsiTTGUvCfhj"
            }
            ```
        ???+ info 
            The variable name in the Json sample must match the corresponding entity in the AI Agent action.

        - Click on **[Parse]**
        - Click on **[Save]**
        

    5. The communicatioh with Airtable requires a perfectly formatted request. In this step, you will use an **Evaluate** Node to act as the "URL Builder" for the [fetch_transactions] action.

        The purpose of this node is to take the raw **CustomerID* and combine it with the necessary API parameters—such as filtering logic, sorting by date, and record limits—into a single, continuous string. By centralizing this logic in an Evaluate Node, you ensure that the complex syntax required by Airtable (like the filterByFormula and sort directions) is pre-processed and ready to be injected into the API call. This prevents errors during the live conversation and ensures Alex always retrieves the 5 most recent transactions in the correct chronological order. 

        ???+ inline end "Screenshot - Set the Evaluate Node"
            <figure markdown>
            ![Set the Evaluate node](./assets/fetch_transactions%20flow%202.png)
            </figure>


        - Drag and drop an **Evaluate** node to the canvas besides the **Start Node**
        - Connect the green outlet of the **Start Node** to the new **Evaluate** node.
        - Double click on the **Evaluate** node
        - Rename the node to <copy>`URL Builder`</code>
        - Copy the below javascript code in the code editor of the node
            ```javascript
            var customerID = "$(n2.aiAgent.CustomerID)";

            var filter = "filterByFormula=" + '{CustomerID}="' + customerID + '"';
            var sort = "sort[0][field]=Date&sort[0][direction]=desc";
            var limit = "maxRecords=5";

            var formula = "?" + filter + "&" + sort + "&" + limit;

            1;
            ```
            
            ???+ warning
                Make sure the $(n2.aiAgent.CustomerID) variable corresponds to your CustomerID variable in the Start Node. You can pick it up by selecting it from the **Input Variables** right panel, under the **Start** section. 
            
            
            ???+ info 
                The proposed JavaScript logic serves as a dynamic query builder for the specific syntax required by the query we need. Apart from the `filterByFormula` parameter, the query includes a `sort` parameter to get the transactions in descending chronological order based on the *Date* field. It also includes a `maxRecords` filter to limit the number of transactions the maximum of 5.

        - Set the **Script Output** value to `1`
        - Set the **Branch Name** value to `Success`
        - Click on **[Save]**
        - Save the flow

        
    6. In the last step you will fetch the customer data from your Airtable Customers repository. 

        ???+ Important
            This part of the flow will leverage the Airtable API generated from your *Transactions* table. So you must have:

            - your Airtable base created, with the Transactions Table populated
            - your [Airtable API](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) handy for your base (from the API Reference site, click on the base you created for the Bootcamp. To see personalized documentation generated for your bases, log in to Airtable). Your Airtable Base API is available at `https://airtable.com/<yourBaseID>/api/docs`
            - Your [Personal Access token](https://airtable.com/create/tokens) created.  

            The API we will use in this flow will be as follows: 

            ``` text
            GET     https://api.airtable.com/v0/<yourBaseID>/Transactions
            ```

            To fetch the correct entry, we will use the URL query parameters set to the string value returned by the **Evaluate** node.

            ![Using API to fetch transactions](./assets/fetch_transactions%20flow%203.png)
            </figure>
        
        
        - Drag and drop an **HTTP Request** node to the canvas besides the **Evaluate** node
        - Connect the green outlet of the **Evaluate** node to the new **HTTP Request** node.
        - Double click on the **HTTP Request** node
        - Rename the node to <copy>`Fetch Transactions Info`</code>
        - Fill in the parameters as follows: 

            | Parameter | Value | Notes |
            | :--- | :--- | :--- |
            | **Method** | `GET` | |
            | **Endpoint URL** | <copy>`https://api.airtable.com/v0/<yourBaseID>/Transactions$(formula)` </copy>| Replace `yourBaseID` with the value of your Airtable Base|
            | **Header** | <copy>`Authorization`</copy>  |  |
            | **Value** | `Bearer <yourPersonalToken>` |  Enter `yourPersonalToken`from [Airtable](https://airtable.com/create/tokens)|

            | **Request Timeout** | <copy>`10000`</copy> |  |

        - We will not fill any Output Variables in this case. As you will see below, in the flow Output Variables we will provide the entire output of the HTTP Request, which will contain the list of transactions fetched. So we do not need to extract any specific variable here. 

        ???+ inline end "Return transactions"

        - To complete the node, click on the green outlet at the right and drag it to the canvas. Release it to open the **End** dialogue

            - Set the **Node Event** value to `onSuccess`
            - Set the **Flow Result** value to `101 - Successfully completed flow [Success]`
            - Click on **[Save]**
        - Save the flow!


    7. To finish your fulfillment flow, we need to pass on the output variables back to your AI Agent through the **Flow Outcomes**

        - Click on the :fontawesome-solid-gear: button at the top right of the flow editor. 
        - Click on the **Flow Outcomes** tab
        - Open the `Last Execution Status` Outcome. The *Notify AI Agent* radio button is enabled by default for the start node with `AI Agent` as the trigger.
        - Click on **+ Add New** for the only variable we will return here: the *HTTP.responseBody*. Fetch the **Value** variable from the **Input Variables** right panel, under the **HTTP Request** section.

## Lab 2.4 - Test the AI Agent

Before going live, it is essential to validate that Alex follows the programmed logic and security guardrails. In this section, you will use the preview tool in the AI Agent Studio to simulate customer scenarios. You will verify that the agent correctly refuses to disclose debt before authentication, handles partial payment negotiations, automates debt payment, and—most importantly—triggers an immediate escalation to a human specialist when a "suspicious transaction" is mentioned.
