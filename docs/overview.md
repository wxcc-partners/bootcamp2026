## Bootcamp Description

By leveraging cutting-edge functionality, you will learn to deliver fully connected customer journeys for **Webex Bank**, a fictitious retail banking entity. Our goal is to demonstrate how to boost debt recovery while significantly cutting agent workload through state-of-the-art AI automation.

The bootcamp is structured as a progressive, hands-on implementation, where each lab builds on the previous one to create a complete customer journey.

You will work within your own WxCC tenant (Gold Tenant or NFR demo/lab) to deploy a production-like scenario that combines outbound engagement, AI automation, and human-assisted resolution.

**Day 1 – Proactive Automation & AI Foundations**

- Lab 1 - *Proactive Outbound Reach*
    Configure the Native Campaign Manager to trigger voice calls based on debt maturity dates found in your Airtable database.

- Lab 2 - *Automated Customer Engagement* 
    Build an autonomous AI Agent capable of authenticating customers, retrieving debt balances, offering payment options and generating and delivering payment links via NovaPay integration.

**Day 2: Advanced Orchestration & Human-in-the-Loop AI**

- Lab 3 - *Value of the Human Touch* 
    Implement intelligent escalation to a Human Fraud Specialist, including full context transfer via VA Summary, Real-time agent guidance with RT Assist and automated wrap-up and backend actions.

- Lab 4 - *Cross-Skill and Multi-Agent Orchestration* 
    Desing a multi-agent architecture where a Debt Collection AI Agent hands off to an Investment Advisor AI Agent, using Agent transfer capabilities, and automate scheduled appointments with a human advisor.

## Lab Infrastructure & Pre-requisites

To ensure a smooth experience during the bootcamp, the following must be pre-configured in your Gold Tenant before starting Lab 1:

1. Digital Channel for Outbound Notifications
    A digital channel must be enabled to allow the AI Agent to send payment links. Recommended: Email channel via Webex Connect

2. Airtable Base (Customer Data Repository)
    You must configure an Airtable Base that will act as the Customer Debt Database, including Customers table, Transactions table and Investments table. 

    This database will be used by AI Agents for customer authentication, debt retrieval, transaction validation and investment advisory scenarios

Additionally, you will leverage the **NovaPay mock-payment service** built for the purpose of this Bootcamp. The NovaPay service provides a mockpayment frontend web site that mimics a typical payment user interface and a web service that exposes an API to create payment sessions, accept payments and check the payment status. Should you want to replicate the Novapay services for your demos, the [Extra Lab](lab_novapay.md) in this Bootcamp provides you a **step-by-step guide** to do so.

Detailed setup instructions are provided in the [Pre-requisites](pre_req_email_channel.md) section of the lab guides.
